Sublime-FileRack [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/philippotto/Sublime-FileRack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/philippotto/Sublime-FileRack)
================

FileRack is a Sublime Text 3 package which focuses on simplifying management of "non-source-files". These include files like to-do-lists, code snippets and other arbitrary notes.

Most of the time I write my notes in Sublime, but I don't want to deal with saving them (which includes giving a proper name and a proper location). Often these files are project-independent which is why it is hard to find a proper location. It gets even harder when I want to open a file and I cannot remember where I put it.
Programs like Evernote solve this by saving files automatically in a pre-defined location. Files get automatically saved after modifications and opening a file is as easy as scrolling (or searching) through your note list.
The disadvantage: it's Evernote and not Sublime.

FileRack offers a similar functionality. Just put an open buffer in your FileRack (by invoking a shortcut or via the command palette). After that, this file will be saved automatically after each modification. To reopen the file just use the ```show_filerack``` command and see a list of your FileRack-files.
